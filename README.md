SteelDrum-COMP-401
==================

Capstone group project with a faculty member as the main client.

This is a Steel Drum teaching application written in C++ for Windows desktop. The files include the Visual Studio 2012 project
file and required audio and visual samples.  

It was created to teach a Steel Drum team the Trinidadian tune "Mr. Fete" on a steel drum.  The final version uses a Tenor Steel pan which plays the melody of the song.

It teaches through call and response("Simon") style memorization.
